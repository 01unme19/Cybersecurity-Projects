# Cybersecurity-Projects (My very first project)
This repository contains all of my cyber-security projects during my learning phase including my personal AI designed Syllabus using tools like ChatGPT, CoPilot, Gemini. And this is my firstGithub Repository as well.
This repository will have all of my projects for each and every topic throgh out my learning sessions. 
The best part is this syllabus is fully customized by myself using some very well known AI tools which contains of all the important topics and one liner notes as well.
Creating a Github repository and documenting my projects is also One of my Project.
